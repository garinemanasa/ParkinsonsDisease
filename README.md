## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing smartwatch sensor data to study movement patterns in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Atypical Parkinsonism, Multiple Sclerosis, Essential Tremor, and other related conditions. The goal was to identify significant patterns and provide insights into disease progression.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Data Processing & Optimization**: Handled 12+ million records, reduced load times by summarizing movement data at 20-microsecond intervals, and aggregated sensor readings for efficient visualization.
- **Data Transformation**: Created calculated fields, parameters, and filters to customize movement analysis based on Kinetic, Postural, and Resting states.
- **Dashboard Development**: Built interactive dashboards for demographics, tremor analysis, and risk prediction, helping visualize trends in disease progression.
- **Movement & Tremor Analysis**: Identified patterns in Parkinson’s-related tremors and their correlation with BMI, age, gender, and disease duration.
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorized high-risk patients based on family history, non-motor symptoms, and biomarker data.

## Key Insights and Findings
- **Demographics**: 59% of subjects had Parkinson’s, with obesity and overweight being prevalent.
- **Tremor Patterns**: Resting tremors were the most severe, with 40% of male and 17% of female Parkinson’s patients affected.
- **Risk Factors**: Overweight individuals with family history and sleep/fatigue complaints were ▋
